Helper application for playing Dominions 4 games via Llamaserver.

Works with a GMail account. You need to add the email and password to a config file and set the account accessible by less secure apps (https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps), so you may want to create a new GMail account for this. IMAP also needs to be enabled in the GMail settings ('Forwarding and POP/IMAP').
